# Google Dictionary API

This is a fork of https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI

## Getting Started

To use, pass the query string with parameter `define` equal to the word you want to get the meaning of.

Eg. `/?define=hello`, will give you the Google dictionary definition of **hello**:

```json
{
  "word": "hello",
  "phonetic": [
    "həˈləʊ",
    "hɛˈləʊ"
  ],
  "meaning": {
    "exclamation": [
      {
        "definition": "used as a greeting or to begin a telephone conversation.",
        "example": "hello there, Katie!"
      }
    ],
    "noun": [
      {
        "definition": "an utterance of ‘hello’; a greeting.",
        "example": "she was getting polite nods and hellos from people"
      }
    ],
    "verb": [
      {
        "definition": "say or shout ‘hello’.",
        "example": "I pressed the phone button and helloed"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


Optionally you can also send another parameter `lang` equal to code of the language in which the word appear.

Eg. `/?define=Bonjour&lang=fr`, will give you definition of **Bonjour** as present in French Dictionary.

```json
{
  "word": "bonjour",
  "meaning": {
    "nom_masculin": [
      {
        "definition": "Souhait de bonne journée (adressé en arrivant, en rencontrant).",
        "synonyms": [
          "salut"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
